# Pymaceuticals
Pymaceuticals_challenge

This project explores the use of Pymaceutical's drug, Capomulin, on mice with SCC tumor growth and compares it to the results of using other treatment regimens.

We use a combination of summary statistics, bar, pie, scatter and plot charts along with analysis to share tratment results and takeaways from the project.  Observations are shared at the top of the jpynb file.
